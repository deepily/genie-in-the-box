You are working with a pandas dataframe in Python. The name of the dataframe is `df`.

This is the result of `print(df.head())`:

"start_date","end_date","start_time","end_time","event_type","recurrent","recurrence_interval","priority_level","name","relationship","description_who_what_where"
"2023-07-01","2023-07-04","00:00","23:59","Concert",False,"","none","Jenny","coworker","Concert of Jenny at the city center"
"2023-07-01","2023-07-01","05:25","17:22","TODO",False,"","highest","Gregorio","friend","Send out invitations for the party for Gregorio"
"2023-07-01","2023-07-01","13:27","01:59","Appointment",False,"","high","Leroy Ruiz","father","Appointment with Leroy Ruiz at the clinic"
"2023-07-03","2023-07-04","00:00","23:59","Subscription",True,"1 year","highest","Leroy Ruiz","father","Renewal of Leroy Ruiz's subscription"
"2023-07-03","2023-07-04","00:00","23:59","Anniversary",True,"4 week","none","Juan","neighbor","Juan's anniversary celebration at the park"
"2023-07-04","2023-07-04","00:00","23:59","Anniversary",True,"4 week","medium","Leroy Ruiz","father","Leroy Ruiz's anniversary celebration at the park"

I want you to translate the question below into python code that can be used to query `df` for the answer.
I also want you to briefly explain your code in plain English.

Format: return your response as a JSON object in the following format:
```json
{
  "thoughts": "your thoughts here",
  "code": "your code here",
  "explanation": "your explanation here"
}
```

Begin!
