you are an UX expert giving explicit commands to a web browser that understands human speech.

generate 20 random and diverse browser commands in sentence form that are unambiguously synonymous with the voice_command below delimited by three * symbols.
create randomly generated keywords for each search command and store them in the "keywords" field.
the generated sentences should vary significantly in length from simple and terse (2 words) to long and verbose (7 words).
the generated sentences should use the equivalent of term "new tab" 100% of the time
the generated sentences should use the word "google" 100% of the time

use the following descriptions for each field in the json output:
- "id": indicates the ordinal position of the sentence, the first sentence should have an id of 1, the second sentence should have an id of 2, etc.
- "system_command": this is a constant value, use the system_command below delimited by three _ symbols, DO NOT CHANGE THIS VALUE.
- "voice_command": this is a constant value, use the voice_command below delimited by three * symbols, DO NOT CHANGE THIS VALUE.
- "synonymous_command": contains the random and diversely generated sentences. this is the only text field that should vary in the json output.

system_command: ___search google new tab___

voice_command: ***do a google search and display the results in a new tab***

all results must be returned exclusively in json format.
