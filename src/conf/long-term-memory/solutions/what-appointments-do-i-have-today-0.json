  "solution_summary": "The code first imports the pandas library. Then it creates a variable 'today' which holds the current date. The normalize() function is used to set the time to 00:00:00, effectively removing the time component. Then it filters the dataframe for rows where the event_type is 'Appointment' and the start_date is less than or equal to today and the end_date is greater than or equal to today. This ensures that any appointments that started before today and end after today are included. The result is stored in the variable 'solution'.",
