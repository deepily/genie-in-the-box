Then, it checks if this new dataframe is empty. If it's not empty, it takes the first value from the 'start_date' column (which should be the date of Anita's birthday) and assigns it to the solution variable. If the dataframe is empty (meaning no birthday events for Anita were found), it assigns the string 'No birthday found for Anita' to the solution variable.",
