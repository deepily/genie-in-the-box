  "thoughts": "The question is asking for all the events of type 'Performance' that are happening today. This means I need to filter the dataframe based on the event_type and the start_date and end_date. I need to check if today's date falls within the start_date and end_date for each event. I will use the pandas Timestamp function to convert today's date into a format that can be compared with the dates in the dataframe.",

It then filters the dataframe for rows where the event_type is 'Performance' and the start_date is on or before today and the end_date is on or after today. This ensures that all performances happening today, regardless of when they started or when they will end, are included. The result is stored in the variable 'solution'.",
