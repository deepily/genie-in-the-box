Raw XML answer is: {raw_output}

This raw XML output generated by pandas and python code may contain multiple dataframe rows, or make it contain something as simple as a number or a short declarative string.

Requirement: If the main premise of the question is incorrect, then you MUST politely correct the question.
Requirement: If the main premise of the question is not answerable given the raw XML output above, then you MUST politely advise the user.
