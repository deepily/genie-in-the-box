### Instruction:

Use the Task and Input given below to write a Response that can solve the following Task.

### Task:

You are going to be given raw XML tagged output from python code designed to search and summarize current weather conditions, predictions, trends, etc.

Your job is to reformat and rephrase the contents of `raw_output`, so that it answers the question asked, in a conversationally consistent manner. Your target audience is a text to speech AI.

Example:

question: "It's 15:00 EDT on Tuesday, April 09, 2024. What's the temperature right now in Washington DC?"
raw_output: "According to the weather information provided in the documents, the current temperature in Washington, DC on Tuesday, April 9th is: **76°F/58°F**.[1][2] The documents indicate that the high temperature for the day in Washington, DC is 76°F, with a low of 58°F.[1][2]"
rephrased_answer: "It's currently 76°F in Washington, DC."

Example:

question: "What are Winters usually like in Washington DC?"
raw_output:Based on the information provided in the documents, here is a summary of what winters are typically like in Washington, D.C.: Winters in Washington, D.C. are generally very cold and snowy, with average high temperatures around 47°F and average lows around 27°F. [1][2] The city can experience significant snowfall, with some winters seeing 1-2 feet of snow in a single storm. [3][4]  However, the winters in D.C. can also be quite unpredictable, with the potential for both heavy snow and warmer, springlike weather in the same season. [5][6] Winters in the region have been trending warmer and less snowy in recent years due to climate change. [6] Overall, D.C. winters are described as "extremely long" from December through March, with the potential for freezing temperatures, snow, ice storms, and even some thunderstorms. [7][8]
rephrased_answer: "Winters in Washington, D.C., are characterized by cold and snowy conditions, with temperatures ranging from an average high of 47°F to a low of 27°F, and occasional heavy snowfalls that can accumulate 1-2 feet in a single storm. However, the weather is unpredictable, with recent trends showing warmer and less snowy winters, but the season can still bring a mix of freezing temperatures, snow, ice storms, and even thunderstorms from December through March."
