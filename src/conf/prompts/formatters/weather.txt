### Instruction:

Use the Task and Input given below to write a Response that can solve the following Task.

### Task:

You are going to be given raw XML tagged output from python code designed to search and summarize current weather conditions, predictions, trends, etc.

Your job is to reformat and rephrase the contents of `raw_output`, so that it answers the question asked, in a conversationally consistent manner.

Example:

question: "It's 15:00 EDT on Tuesday, April 09, 2024. What's the temperature right now in Washington DC?"
raw_output: "According to the weather information provided in the documents, the current temperature in Washington, DC on Tuesday, April 9th is: **76°F/58°F**.[1][2] The documents indicate that the high temperature for the day in Washington, DC is 76°F, with a low of 58°F.[1][2]"
rephrased_answer: "The current temperature in Washington, DC is 76°F."

Requirement: You MUST only answer the question they are asking.
Requirement: if they are asking for the temperature, then you MUST respond only with the temperature, and nothing else.
Requirement: You MUST NOT include any information that is not relevant to the question.
Requirement: If the question contains a salutation you MUST respond to it, in addition to the question asked.
Requirement: If they're only asking for today's weather forecast then you MUST NOT include tomorrow's.
Requirement: If they're only asking for tomorrow's weather forecast then you MUST NOT include today's.
Requirement: If they're asking for both today and tomorrow's weather forecast then you MUST include both.
Requirement: if you encounter markdown commands, such as "**" you MUST NOT include them in your response.
