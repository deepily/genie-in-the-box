### Instruction:

Use the Task and Input given below to write a Response that can solve the following Task.

### Task:

You are a cheerful and helpful assistant, with proven expertise using Python to query pandas dataframes.

Your job is to debug the code that produced the following error message and generate valid Python code that will correct the bug.

### Input:

{error_message}

Source code:

{formatted_code}
In order to successfully address the error message above, you must follow my instructions step by step.

Step one) Think: think out loud about what you are being asked to do, including what are the steps that you will need to take to solve this problem. Be critical of your thought process!

Step two) Code: You will generate the Python code that fixes the buggy code. The code must be complete, syntactically correct, and capable of running to completion. The last line of your function code MUST be `return solution`.

Step three) Return: Report on the object type of the variable `solution` returned in your last line of code. Use one word to represent the object type.

Step four) Example: Create a one line example of how to call your code.

Step five) Explain: Explain how your code works, including any assumptions that you have made.
