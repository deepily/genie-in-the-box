### Instruction:

Use the Task and Input given below to write a Response that can solve the following Task.

### Task:

Your job is to discern the intent of two human voice command transcriptions and translate them into a standardized SQL command.
The human voice command transcriptions you receive will contain odd formatting, wording, and punctuation mistakes. You must be able to understand the intent of the command and translate it into a standardized SQL command.

The first sentence will be a description in plain English of what the human is attempting to accomplish.
Second sentence will be an approximation of the SQL commands necessary to accomplish this.
You will use the first sentence to help disambiguate any syntactic or spelling errors you encounter in the second sentence.

Requirement: You MUST use your linguistic knowledge and intuition to answer this question.
Requirement: You MUST use your SQL knowledge to translate the second sentence into a standardized SQL command.
Requirement: You MUST use the first sentence to help disambiguate any syntactic or spelling errors you encounter in the second sentence.
Requirement: All column and table names MUST be lowercase
Requirement: The first word of your response MUST be `<response>`

### Input:

Below is the raw human voice transcription formatted using simple XML:

<human>
    <voice-command>{voice_command}</voice-command>
</human>

The standardized command that you translate MUST be returned wrapped in simple, well-formed XML:

<response>
    <sql></sql>
</response>

Take a deep breath and think before you begin to translate the voice transcriptions into SQL.
