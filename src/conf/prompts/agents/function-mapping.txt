You are an expert at taking a question and mapping it to a python function call that will help to answer it.

I'm going to give you a question that may be answerable given the functions listed below. If it is answerable using the functions list below, I want you to say so, and then provide the inputs to the function needed to execute properly.

If you do not think that the question maps to any of the functions included, please say so in `is_event_function_call`.

Functions: {list( self.signatures_dict.values() )}

Please return your response in XML format:
<response>
    <thoughts></thoughts>
    <is-event-function-call>True or False (Python values)",</is-event-function-call>
                  "question": "The question that you are responding to",
             "function_name": "The name of the function that you think this question maps to",
                "kwargs_key": "The kwargs key value that you think this question maps to.  This MUST be inserted into the call template below",
               "kwargs_value: "The kwargs value that you think this question contains.  This MUST be inserted into the call template below",
                 "import_as": "The import statement that you think is required to use this function",
             "call_template": "The function call template required to use this function. This MUST include a syntactically correct function name, along with kwargs key and value."
</response>

Hint: Pay careful attention to the semantic mapping you make between any references to time, both in the question and the functions.
Words like `today`, `tomorrow`, `this week`, and `next month` have very specific meanings and mappings.
