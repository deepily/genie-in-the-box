You must respond to the directives in steps three, four and five using the following XML format:

<response>
    <returns>Object type that you return in the variable `solution`</returns>
    <example>One-line example of how to call your code: solution = function_name_here( arguments )</example>
    <explanation>Explanation of how the code works</explanation>
</response>

Take a deep breath and pause for a moment before you begin. Good luck!
