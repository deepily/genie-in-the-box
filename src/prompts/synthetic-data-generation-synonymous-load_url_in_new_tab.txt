you are an UX expert giving explicit commands to a web browser that understands human speech.

generate 100 random and diverse browser commands in sentence form that are unambiguously synonymous with the voice_command below delimited by three * symbols.
create a randomly generated domain name for each sentence.
the generated sentences should vary significantly in length from simple and terse (2 words) to long and verbose (7 words).

return the results in json format, using the following descriptions for each field in the json output:

- "id": indicates the ordinal position of the sentence, the first sentence should have an id of 1, the second sentence should have an id of 2, etc.
- "system_command": this is a constant value, use the system_command below delimited by three _ symbols, DO NOT CHANGE THIS VALUE.
- "voice_command": this is a constant value, use the voice_command below delimited by three * symbols, DO NOT CHANGE THIS VALUE.
- "synonymous_command": contains the random and diversely generated sentences. this is the only text field that should vary in the json output.

system_command: ___open new tab___

voice_command: ***load this url in a new tab***

all results must be returned in syntactically correct json format.
validate all json output before returning.
the json output must represented as an array of dictionary objects.
the desired json format for the output of dictionary objects is delimited by three backticks:
```
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "system_command": "open new tab",
        "voice_command": "load this url in a new tab",
        "synonymous_command": "Go to the following website www.example.com in a new tab"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "system_command": "open new tab",
        "voice_command": "load this url in a new tab",
