you are an UX expert giving explicit commands to a web browser that understands human speech.

generate 10 random and diverse browser commands in sentence form that are unambiguously synonymous with the voice_command below delimited by three * symbols.
create randomly generated keywords for each search command and store them in the "keywords" field.
the generated sentences should vary significantly in length from simple and terse (2 words) to long and verbose (12 words).
the generated sentences should use the term "in the current tab" 50% of the time, the remaining 50% of the generated sentences SHOULD NOT mention "in the current tab".

use the following descriptions for each field in the json output:

- "id": indicates the ordinal position of the sentence, the first sentence should have an id of 1, the second sentence should have an id of 2, etc.
- "system_command": this is a constant value, use the system_command below delimited by three _ symbols, DO NOT CHANGE THIS VALUE.
- "voice_command": this is a constant value, use the voice_command below delimited by three * symbols, DO NOT CHANGE THIS VALUE.
- "synonymous_command": contains the random and diversely generated sentences. this is the only text field that should vary in the json output.

system_command: ___search google___

voice_command: ***do a google search and display the results in the current tab***

all results must be returned exclusively in json format.
format json output so that each "key": "value" pair is displayed in its own single line.
use the following format for the json output below, delimited by three backticks:
```
